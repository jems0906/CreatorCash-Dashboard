# CreatorCash – Monetization Dashboard

A real-time creator monetization dashboard built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. Simulates a TikTok-style earnings platform with live WebSocket data, inline ad injection, a sponsored brand marketplace, and A/B testing analytics.

---

## Features

- **Live Earnings Feed** — Simulated WebSocket streams RPM, CPM, view counts, and ad impressions every 1.5 s (throttled to 4 s when tab is hidden)
- **Payout Projections** — Daily / weekly / monthly / yearly estimates with a confidence bar derived from engagement rate
- **30-Day Performance Graph** — Interactive area chart with toggleable metrics (Earnings, RPM, CPM, Views)
- **Hourly Breakdown Table** — 120-row sortable/filterable earnings table with trend indicators
- **Sponsored Marketplace** — Swipeable brand deal carousel with accept/reject gestures, category filters, and audience-match scoring
- **Inline Ad Engine** — Deterministic ad injection into the video feed every 3 posts, with impression logging and revenue projection
- **A/B Testing Panel** — Live two-proportion z-test confidence calculations, pause/resume controls, and uplift tracking
- **Dark / Light Mode** — CSS custom properties theme switching via `data-theme` attribute

## Deployment

The production build outputs a fully static site to `dist/`. Deploy to any static host:

**Render (recommended)**
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) → New → **Static Site**
2. Connect your GitHub repo (`jems0906/CreatorCash-Dashboard`)
3. Render auto-detects `render.yaml` — no manual config needed
4. Click **Create Static Site**

The `render.yaml` in the repo sets:
- Build command: `npm install; npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`
- SPA rewrite rule: all routes → `index.html`

**Netlify / Vercel / GitHub Pages**
```bash
npm run build
# deploy the dist/ folder
```

No server-side rendering or API routes — all data is generated client-side.
